      <h2>Your Messages, Encrypted Before They Leave Your Device</h2>
      <div class="encryption-diagram"> </div>
      <p>
        When you create a secure message on Whispeer, it's encrypted right
        within your web browser or mobile device. This means that only you and
        the person you share the passphrase with can ever read the message â€“ not
        even Whispeer can access it.

      <h2>Disappearing Messages: How We Do It</h2>
      <div class="disappearing-message-diagram"> </div>
      <p>
        Every message on Whispeer has a lifespan of 24 hours. After that, it's
        automatically and permanently deleted from our servers. You don't have to
        worry about old messages hanging around.

      <p>
        To make Whispeer better, we use anonymized analytics. This means we
        track overall usage patterns, but without collecting any personal
        information about you. We'll never compromise your privacy for data.

      <h2>Strong Passphrases are Key</h2>
      <div class="strong-passphrases-diagram"> </div>
      <p>
        When you choose to encrypt a message, your passphrase is vital. Here's
        how to make strong passphrases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
        <li>Make them at least 12 characters long.</li>
        <li>Never reuse passphrases on other websites or services.</li>
      </ul>
